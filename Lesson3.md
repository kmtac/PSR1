# Lesson 3
- Story: [Noah's Ark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzYjy6lhRag)
- Book chapter: 3
- Activity book pages: 8-11, 25
- Prayers:
  - The Sign of the Cross
     - Note you make a cross with your arm
     - Jesus is the Son
     - This reminds us how Jesus opened the gates of heaven for us.
  - The Our Father
    - Kids repeat after an adult
    - Focus: "Our Father": 
      - God is the father of everyone!  Those in Berea, Columbia Station, Olmsted Falls, Sandusky, Michigan, Texas, ...
      - God is in heaven.  ("Art" is an old-fashioned way of saying "are.")
  - Genuflecting
  - Talking to God in your own words
  - Gratefulness: List things you would like to thank God for.  Go on a walk and notice things to thank God for.
  - Visit Jesus in the Chapel to say "Hi!"  (Literally: This is what we said this week.)
  
## Homeschool/missed class plan
- Read, watch, or tell:  Noah's Ark.  If you choose to watch, here's a [link to a 4-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzYjy6lhRag).
- Read: Chapter 3
- Practice and Pray: The Sign of the Cross, the Our Father, and genuflecting
  - Our Father: 
      - Review the first phrase: "Our Father"  (God is everyone's Father)
      - Go over the second phrase: "Who art in Heaven": Discuss heaven.  Also explain that "art" is an old-fashioned way of saying "are".
  - Practice genuflecting.  
- Developing a relationship with God:
  - Point 1: Only God can create something out of nothing.
    - We use things God has made to create things, but God can create things out of nothing.
    - Back a couple weeks ago, we heard how God created the world.  After creating the world, God said that it was "good".  After creating Adam and Eve, He said that it was "very good."
  - Point 2: God always loves and cares for us.
  - Poirt 3: God created angels.  God gave each of us a guardian angel.
  - Continue to notice things to thank God for.  This is a continuing theme for this semester.  
  - Optional.  Do one or more of the [Continuing Activities](#ContinuingActivities) below. 
  
### <a name="ContinuingActivities"> Continuing activities for Developing a relationship with God </a>
- Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank God for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
- Optional. Pick flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
- Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle $-$ a couple minutes are fine.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus, but I realize that this may not be as easy for homeschool families.  Perhaps you might be able to do this occasionally, either now or after a coronavirus vaccine has been developed.  
    - Near or in Berea, St. Adalbert has Eucharistic Adoration from 9:00 to 6:30pm Tuesdays.  St. Mary of the Falls has Eucharistic Adoration from 7-8pm Tuesdays.  (Based on my experience, St. Mary of the Falls is as good about masking as St. Mary, Berea: Everyone in the church is wearing a mask.  St. Adalbert, from my very limited pandemic experience, isn't as good: In the pandemic version of a "full" church, you might have one or two people not wearing masks.  But I wouldn't expect St. Adalbert to have many people before about 5pm on Tuesdays.)
