# PSR Grade 1

The themes for this year are God's love for us and our response to Him.  We learn about God by reading Bible stories, from the Old Testament from September to early November and from the New Testament after that.  I tell these stories using children's Bibles and videos.  The book typically gives very brief versions of the stories.  Its main emphasis is framing the stories in the context of God's love for us.  **The chapters are short: typically 4 pages with no more than 3 pages of text. Everything in the book is important and you should read it at home with your child before or after class, even if your child is attending PSR in person.**  During class, we cover the material in the book through discussion, stories, and games.  We also learn about responding to God's love through prayer: learning the prayers the Sign of the Cross, the Our Father, and the Hail Mary; talking to God in our own words; listing things we would like to thank Him for; preparing flowers to bring to Him in the tabernacle (a very popular activity); and very briefly visiting Him in the tabernacle in the school chapel.  

Text: **Our Heavenly Father** textbook and activity book, 3rd edition, Ignatius Press.
Required Supplement: Bible stories.  These can be from a children's Bible, videos of Bible stories, or parents telling Bible stories to their children.  In class, I usually use **A First Bible Story Book**, stories retold by Mary Hoffman, Tyndale House Publishers, Inc.  I supplement this with videos and other children's Bibles.  There are plenty of other good children's Bibles around.  Especially for homeschool students, I'm providing links to online videos of the Bible stories we're covering as an alternative to reading the stories.

Homeschool students lesson checksheets: [pdf](HomeschoolChecksheet.pdf) [xlsx](HomeschoolChecksheet.xlsx) Turn in the checksheets at the end of each semester (December and May) OR email me each week saying you've completed the lesson OR propose another way to document your child's work.

A summary of the 2020-2021 lesson plan is given in the table below.  As the weeks go by, the table will continue to be filled in.  In addition, each lesson will link to its own web page.  You can expect the pages to appear by the day after class (with the exception of the first lesson, which will appear by Sep. 20.)  If you are homeschooling, you will receive an email each week which includes a link to the lesson's web page as well as the content of the web page in the email itself.

Formed has a second children's video on St. Patrick in the Cathoilc Heroes of the Faith collection.  I like the linked Saints & Heroes collection video better for first graders becasue it has a lighter tone.  First graders are at the very lower end of recommended age for the other videos.
