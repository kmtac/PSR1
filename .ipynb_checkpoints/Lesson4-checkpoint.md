# Lesson 4
- Story: [Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac](https://vimeo.com/44930545)
   - I tell the story from Abraham and Sarah leaving their home to Isaac's birth to the sacrifice of the ram in place of Isaac.
   - The linked video just tells the first part, Abraham and Sarah leaving their home and Isaac's birth.
   - Either is fine.  The Activity Book p. 26 asks your child do draw God providing a ram in place of Isaac.  It's fine to skip this page if you didn't cover that part of the story.
- Book chapter: 4
- Activity book pages: 13-16, 26
- Prayers:
  - The Sign of the Cross
     - Note you make a cross with your arm
     - Jesus is the Son
     - This reminds us how Jesus opened the gates of heaven for us.
  - The Our Father
    - Kids repeat after an adult
    - Focus: "Our Father": 
      - God is the father of everyone!  Those in Berea, Columbia Station, Olmsted Falls, Sandusky, Michigan, Texas, ...
      - God is in heaven.  
  - Genuflecting
  - Talking to God in your own words
  - Gratefulness: List things you would like to thank God for.  Go on a walk and notice things to thank God for.
  - Visit Jesus in the Chapel to say "Hi!" 
  
## Homeschool/missed class plan
- Read, watch, or tell: Abraham, Sarah, and Isaac.  If you choose to watch, here's a [link to a 4-minute video](https://vimeo.com/44930545)
- Read: Chapter 4
- Practice and Pray: The Sign of the Cross, the Our Father, and genuflecting
  - Our Father: 
      - Review the first phrase: "Our Father"  (God is everyone's Father)
      - Go over the second phrase: "Who art in Heaven": Discuss heaven.
      - Go over the third phrase: "Hallowed be thy name"
        - "Thy" is another way of saying "your."
        - God's name is holy.  Holy is not really a first-grader-friendly concept.  
          - I teach them the words -- "Hallowed by thy name" means "God's name is holy."  
          - I also teach them that we always say God's name in a nice way.  
  - Practice genuflecting.  
- Developing a relationship with God:
  - Point 1: God created us with a body and soul.
  - Do activity book p. 14, The Order of Creation
    - Rock - not alive
    - Plants - alive
    - Animals - alive, have a body, can be trained
    - People - alive, have a body and soul.  Souls help us to think, love, and choose.
  - You cannot see your soul.  
  - We are made in the image and likeness of God.
- Point 2: God wants us to know, love, and serve him so that we may be with Him in heaven.
  - God wants us to take care of our body and take care of our soul.
  - Option 1: List ways to care for our body.  Then list ways to care for our souls.
  - Option 2: Life-size board game: Set up a long, winding train of chairs or other convenient markers.  Take turners rolling a die to go forward from "Start" to "Home".  Before each roll of the die, ask your child "What's something you can do that's good for your body?" (eat, sleep, brush teeth, play, exercise, ...) or "What's something you can do that's good for your soul?" (pray, go to church, share, be nice to others, say sorry, say that's ok, ...).  Help them to get a right answer.  For your turn, answer the same question.
  - Option 3: Charades: Caring for our body and for our soul.
- Point 3: God gave us guardian angels.
  - Look at the picture of Tobiah and the archangel Raphael (p.18 of book)
  - Discuss: When might you ask your guardian angel to help you follow God?
- Point 4: God gave us senses so that we can experience and enjoy creation
  - Option 1: Do p. 13 of the activity book.
  - Option 2: Draw on a piece of paper or a chalk
  - Option 3: Make an "Enjoy creation" book
     - Use 1 sheet of plain paper or light-colored construction paper
        - Cut in half the long way (get two 4.25 x 11 pieces)
        - Fold each sheet in half.  Tape the edges or staple to make a book.
         - Front: "Enjoy creation"
         - Pages: "See", "hear", "Smell", "Taste", "Touch", "The end"
         - Draw something you like to see, hear, smell, etc., on the appropriate page.
 
  - Continue to notice things to thank God for.  This is a continuing theme for this semester.  
  - Optional.  Do one of the [Continuing Activities](#ContinuingActivities) below. 
  
### <a name="ContinuingActivities"> Continuing activities for Developing a relationship with God </a>
- Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank God for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
 - Optional. Pick flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
 - Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle -- a couple minutes are fine.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus, but I realize that this may not be as easy for homeschool families.  Perhaps you might be able to do this occasionally, either now or after a coronavirus vaccine has been developed.  
    - Near or in Berea, St. Adalbert has Eucharistic Adoration from 9:00 to 6:30pm Tuesdays.  St. Mary of the Falls has Eucharistic Adoration from 7-8pm Tuesdays.  (Based on my experience, St. Mary of the Falls is as good about masking as St. Mary, Berea: Everyone in the church is wearing a mask.  St. Adalbert, from my very limited pandemic experience, isn't as good: In the pandemic version of a "full" church, you might have one or two people not wearing masks.  But I wouldn't expect St. Adalbert to have many people before about 5pm on Tuesdays.)
