# Lessons 12: Will be done soon -- the below is still Lesson 11, from before Christmas
## Summary
- Focus: Jesus is the Savior!  He was born in Bethlehem on Christmas.  
- Stories: 
  - *The story of Christmas*, up to the Wise Men bringing gifts to the baby Jesus.
    - Please cover this at least twice between now and Christmas.  In class, I usually show a video the first week of Advent and read the story from a children's Bible the second week.  Some years, we also use a Nativity set to act out the story. 
        - Optional videos: 
           - Formed.org: [Brother Francis, Oh Holy Night](https://watch.formed.org/brother-francis-1/season:1/videos/o-holy-night-the-king-is-born-what-christmas-is-about)
           - Cuyahoga County Public Library: Bugtime Adventures *Joy to the World*
           - Many other videos telling the story of Christmas.  For example, the 2017 feature film *The Star*, directed by Timothy Reckart.
     - Complete the map on p. 37 and discuss the distance Mary and Joseph had to walk to get to Bethlehem (about 80 miles, twice the distance from Berea to one of the indoor water parks in Sandusky.)  It would have taken Joseph and Mary about a week.
     - Discuss where Jesus was born.  Is it surprising the Jesus was born in a stable and not a palace?
     - Discuss why Jesus came: to save us from sin and open the gates of heaven.
     - Discuss the Wise Men
         - Who were they?
         - Why were they wise?
         - How did they find Jesus?
         - What gifts did they bring?
            - Explain the meaning of the gifts:
                - Gold: for a king
                - Frankincense: for God
                - Myrhh: for a man (used to anoint the dead)
- Secondary: The story of St. Nicholas.  One option: the Formed.org video [Nicholas: The boy who became Santa](https://watch.formed.org/videos/nicholas-the-boy-who-became-santa).  There's also a VeggieTales version (available, for example, at Cuyahoga County Public Libray).  Optional: Have your child put their shoes outside the room with the video and put a treat in it as they're watching the video.
- Book chapters: 10 and 11.  Please read these chapters.
- Activity book pages: 
  - Required: 37, 38, 40, 41, 43. 
  - Optional pages: 39, 42, 44.  
- Prayers:
  - The Sign of the Cross, genuflecting, talking to God in your own words, gratefulness
  - The Our Father
  - The Hail Mary: Point out to your chlid that this prayer begins with the words the angel Gabriel said to Mary when God sent him to ask Mary to be Jesus' mother. ("Hail Mary, full of grace.  The Lord is with thee.")  
  
  
### <a name="ContinuingActivities"> Continuing activities for Developing a relationship with God </a>
- Optional. Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank God for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
 - Optional. Pick flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus or a nativity scene.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
 - Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle -- a couple minutes are fine.  This can also be done virtually.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus.  
    - St. Adalbert has Eucharistic Adoration from 9:00 to 6:30pm Tuesdays.  St. Mary of the Falls has Eucharistic Adoration from 7-8pm Tuesdays.
