# Lesson 7
- Story: Moses.  
  - The theatrical movie *Prince of Egypt* is a good but long choice (DVD from library, some streaming services)
  - Short option: [Moses, 6 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzcYLCYItuc)
  - In class, we watch *The Greatest Adventures: Moses* episode (30 minutes, available on VHS from Religious Ed library)
  - Reading the story is also fine.
- Optional video: [Halloween/All Saints Day explained with a cheesy Lego animation, about 6 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy66_pgeORA)
- Focus: Waiting for a savior
- Book chapters: 7 and 8
- Activity book pages: 25, 26, 30, 31 (p. 25 and 26 were also listed in previous weeks)
  - Required page: 30.
- Prayers:
  - The Sign of the Cross, genuflecting, talking to God in your own words, gratefulness
  - The Our Father
    - Focus: "Our Father":   
      - "Hallowed be thy name"
        - "Thy" means "your"
        - God's name is holy.
           - "Holy" is not generally in first graders' vocabulary and is a hard concept to explain to first graders.
        - Because God's name is holy, we say it in a nice way.
          - They *do* understand "say it in a nice way."
        - Hallow: All Hallow's Eve, All Hallow's Day (All Saints Day)
  
## Homeschool/missed class plan
- Read, watch, or tell: The story of Moses (see above). 
- Read: Chapters 7 and 8.
  - We've covered most of the stories in Chapters 7 and 8 in previous weeks.
  - This week, we hear the story of Moses and briefly review Noah, Abraham, and Joseph.
  - Although John the Baptist is briefly covered in Chapter 8, we don't cover him until January.
- Practice and Pray: The Sign of the Cross, the Our Father, and genuflecting.
- Developing a relationship with God:
  - Focus 1: God promised to send us a savior, but we had to wait a long time.
    - Discuss waiting -- especially waiting for good things.
    - God promised a savior.  But we had to wait a long time for the savior.  It was hard for people to be faithful and love God while they were waiting.  Some people were faithful:
      - Noah.  God gave Noah a new promise: There would never be a flood that covered the whole earth again.  The rainbow is a sign to reminder us all of God's promise to Noah.  Optional: Do p. 25 if not already done.
      - Abraham.  God also gave Abraham a new promise: His and his wife Sarah's child and this child's children and their descendants would form a great nation.  Optional: Do p. 26 of the activity book if not already done.
      - Joseph.
      - Moses was the first prophet.  Prophets are people who loved God and prepared us for the coming of the Savior, Jesus.
    - Discuss how we can prepare for Jesus.  Do p. 30 of the activity book.
      - First graders will be receiving Jesus in a special way next year in First Communion.  Before that, they will experience another great sacrament of God's love and mercy: First Reconciliation.
  - Focus 2: The 10 commandments teach us how to love.
    - God gave Moses the 10 commandments.  
      - When God gave Moses the 10 commandments, he also gave them to us.  
    - The 10 commandments help us to love and obey God and to love other people.
    - Sometimes, it's hard to love and obey God, but it's important to do.
    - Optional: Do p. 31 of the activity book.
  - Prayer: Continue to practice prayers and to encourage your children to also pray in their own words.
  - Continue to notice things to thank God for.    
  - Continue to discuss how to care for your body and care for your soul.  
  - Optional.  Do one of the [Continuing Activities](#ContinuingActivities) below. 
  
### <a name="ContinuingActivities"> Continuing activities for Developing a relationship with God </a>
- Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank God for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
 - Optional. Pick flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
 - Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle -- a couple minutes are fine.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus, but I realize that this may not be as easy for homeschool families.  Perhaps you might be able to do this occasionally, either now or after a coronavirus vaccine has been developed.  
    - Near or in Berea, St. Adalbert has Eucharistic Adoration from 9:00 to 6:30pm Tuesdays.  St. Mary of the Falls has Eucharistic Adoration from 7-8pm Tuesdays.  (Based on my experience, St. Mary of the Falls is as good about masking as St. Mary, Berea: Everyone in the church is wearing a mask.  St. Adalbert, from my very limited pandemic experience, isn't as good: In the pandemic version of a "full" church, you might have one or two people not wearing masks.  But I wouldn't expect St. Adalbert to have many people before about 5pm on Tuesdays.)
