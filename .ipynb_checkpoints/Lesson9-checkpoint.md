# Lesson 9
- Story: The Annunciation: In class, we read this story from a children's Bible.  A short version of this story is given on p. 34 of the Activity Book. 
- Focus: The savior comes!  
- Book chapters: 9
- Activity book pages: 36. 
  - Optional pages: 33-35.  Please only do the fill-in-the-blank pages (33 and 35) if your child enjoys it.
- Prayers:
  - The Sign of the Cross, genuflecting, talking to God in your own words, gratefulness
  - The Our Father
  - The Hail Mary: Point out to your chlid that this prayer begins with the words the angel Gabriel said to Mary when God sent him to ask Mary to be Jesus' mother. ("Hail Mary, full of grace.  The Lord is with thee.")  
  - The Rosary: This was a first introduction in class, just learning how your fingers move on the beads with each prayer.  
  
## Homeschool/missed class plan
- Read, watch, or tell: The annunciation. 
- Read: Chapter 9 
- Introduce the Hail Mary and the Rosary.  Optional: Watch [the Brother Francis Rosary video (about 30 min)](https://watch.formed.org/brother-francis-1/season:1/videos/the-rosary-a-special-way-to-pray)
  - Prayer: Introduce the Hail Mary and very briefly introducte the Rosary. In class, the students just started to learn how to move their fingers on the beads for each prayer.  Continue to practice the Our Father and the Sign of the Cross and to encourage your children to also pray in their own words.
  - Continue to notice things to thank God for.    
  - Continue to discuss how to care for your body and care for your soul.  
  - Optional.  Do one of the [Continuing Activities](#ContinuingActivities) below. 
  
### <a name="ContinuingActivities"> Continuing activities for Developing a relationship with God </a>
- Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank God for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
 - Optional. Pick flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
 - Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle -- a couple minutes are fine.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus, but I realize that this may not be as easy for homeschool families.  Perhaps you might be able to do this occasionally, either now or after a coronavirus vaccine has been developed.  
    - Near or in Berea, St. Adalbert has Eucharistic Adoration from 9:00 to 6:30pm Tuesdays.  St. Mary of the Falls has Eucharistic Adoration from 7-8pm Tuesdays.  (Based on my experience, St. Mary of the Falls is as good about masking as St. Mary, Berea: Everyone in the church is wearing a mask.  St. Adalbert, from my very limited pandemic experience, isn't as good: In the pandemic version of a "full" church, you might have one or two people not wearing masks.  But I wouldn't expect St. Adalbert to have many people before about 5pm on Tuesdays.)
