## Homeschool/missed class plan
- Discuss saints before All Hallow's Eve and All Saints day.
- Read, watch, or tell: The story of St. Patrick or another saint.  [St. Patrick, Saints and Heroes collection on Formed.org, about 25 min.](https://watch.formed.org/the-saints-and-heroes-collection/season:1/videos/patrick-brave-shepherd-of-the-emerald-isle)    
  - Formed has a second children's video on St. Patrick in the Cathoilc Heroes of the Faith collection.  I like the linked Saints & Heroes collection video better for first graders becasue it has a lighter tone.  First graders are at the very lower end of recommended age for the other videos. 
  - The Saints and Heroes collection on Formed.org is generally good and includes several other saints -- St. Francis of Assisi, St. t

Read, watch, or tell: The story of Joseph.  If you choose to watch, here's a [link to a 90-minute video](https://watch.formed.org/joseph-beloved-son-rejected-slave)
- Read: Chapter 27
- Practice and Pray: The Sign of the Cross, the Our Father, and genuflecting.
  - Our Father: 
  - Practice genuflecting.  
- Developing a relationship with God:
  - Focus 1: Jesus wants us to follow Him.
  - Focus 2: Saints are people who followed Jesus.  They give us examples of following Jesus.  
  - Prayer: Continue to practice prayers and to encourage your children to also pray in their own words.
  - Continue to notice things to thank God for.  This is a continuing theme for this semester.  
  - Continue to discuss how to care for your body and care for your soul.  This is another major theme for this semester.
  - Optional.  Do one of the [Continuing Activities](#ContinuingActivities) below. 
  
### <a name="ContinuingActivities"> Continuing activities for Developing a relationship with God </a>
- Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank God for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
 - Optional. Pick flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
 - Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle -- a couple minutes are fine.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus, but I realize that this may not be as easy for homeschool families.  Perhaps you might be able to do this occasionally, either now or after a coronavirus vaccine has been developed.  
    - Near or in Berea, St. Adalbert has Eucharistic Adoration from 9:00 to 6:30pm Tuesdays.  St. Mary of the Falls has Eucharistic Adoration from 7-8pm Tuesdays.  (Based on my experience, St. Mary of the Falls is as good about masking as St. Mary, Berea: Everyone in the church is wearing a mask.  St. Adalbert, from my very limited pandemic experience, isn't as good: In the pandemic version of a "full" church, you might have one or two people not wearing masks.  But I wouldn't expect St. Adalbert to have many people before about 5pm on Tuesdays.)
