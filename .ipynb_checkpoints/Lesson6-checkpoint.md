# Lesson 6
- Story: [Joseph, his brothers, and the great famine](https://watch.formed.org/joseph-beloved-son-rejected-slave)
   - This story is optional.  
   - The Formed.org video is very long, about 90 minutes.  Reading the story from a children's Bible is a shorter option.
- Book chapters: 5 and 6
- Activity book pages: 17-24
  - Pages 18, 21, 23, and 24 are the key pages
- Prayers:
  - The Sign of the Cross
     - Note you make a cross with your arm
     - Jesus is the Son
     - This reminds us how Jesus opened the gates of heaven for us.
  - The Our Father
    - Kids repeat after an adult
    - Focus: "Our Father": 
      - God is the father of everyone!  Those in Berea, Columbia Station, Olmsted Falls, Sandusky, Michigan, Texas, ...
      - God is in heaven.  
  - Genuflecting
  - Talking to God in your own words
  - Caring for our body and our soul
  - Gratefulness: List things you would like to thank God for.  Go on a walk and notice things to thank God for.
  - Visit Jesus in the Chapel
    - The children take a minute or two in the classroom to decide what to say to Jesue before visiting Him in the chapel.
  
## Homeschool/missed class plan
- Read, watch, or tell: The story of Joseph.  If you choose to watch, here's a [link to a 90-minute video](https://watch.formed.org/joseph-beloved-son-rejected-slave)
- Read: Chapter 5/6
- Key vocabulary: Grace: God's life in your soul.  (See focus 2 below.)
- Key concept: In the beginning, Adam and Eve had grace, God's life in their souls.  They lost it by doing what God had told them not to do (eating the fruit from the forbidden tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil).  Jesus came so that we can have life in our souls again.  (See focus 2 below) 
- Practice and Pray: The Sign of the Cross, the Our Father, and genuflecting
  - Our Father: 
      - Review the first phrase: "Our Father"  (God is everyone's Father)
      - Go over the second phrase: "Who art in Heaven": Discuss heaven.
      - Go over the third phrase: "Hallowed be thy name"
        - "Thy" is another way of saying "your."
        - God's name is holy.  Holy is not really a first-grader-friendly concept.  
          - I teach them the words -- "Hallowed by thy name" means "God's name is holy."  
          - I also teach them that we always say God's name in a nice way.  
  - Practice genuflecting.  
- Developing a relationship with God:
  - Focus 1: Review the story of creation, the fall, and how God promised to send us a savior.
    - Discussion or activity book pages 18 and 21.
    - Activity book pages 17, 19, and 22 are also relevant, but they are optional.  They require substantial adult help unless your chiled is a very good reader.  (In class, I tend to cover this type of material with games instead of workbooks.)
  - Focus 2: Vocabulary - Grace: Grace is the life of God in our souls.  Adam and Eve had grace but lost it for themselves and everyone else by eating the fruit God asked them not to eat.  Jesus came to save us and won back grace for everyone.  
    - Introduce grace as a vocabulary word.
    - Discuss or do activity book p. 20, 23, and 24.
  - Prayer.  One idea - Have your child think about what they might like to say to Jesus.  Then, visit Jesus in a chapel or pray before a statue or picture of Jesus.
    - In class, I suggest to the children tell Jesus something that they're happy about, or sad about, or worried about, or something they're grateful for, or just something that happened.
  - Continue to notice things to thank God for.  This is a continuing theme for this semester.  
  - Continue to discuss how to care for your body and care for your soul.  This is another major theme for this semester.
  - Optional.  Do one of the [Continuing Activities](#ContinuingActivities) below. 
  
### <a name="ContinuingActivities"> Continuing activities for Developing a relationship with God </a>
- Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank God for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
 - Optional. Pick flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
 - Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle -- a couple minutes are fine.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus, but I realize that this may not be as easy for homeschool families.  Perhaps you might be able to do this occasionally, either now or after a coronavirus vaccine has been developed.  
    - Near or in Berea, St. Adalbert has Eucharistic Adoration from 9:00 to 6:30pm Tuesdays.  St. Mary of the Falls has Eucharistic Adoration from 7-8pm Tuesdays.  (Based on my experience, St. Mary of the Falls is as good about masking as St. Mary, Berea: Everyone in the church is wearing a mask.  St. Adalbert, from my very limited pandemic experience, isn't as good: In the pandemic version of a "full" church, you might have one or two people not wearing masks.  But I wouldn't expect St. Adalbert to have many people before about 5pm on Tuesdays.)
