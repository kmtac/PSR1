## At-home class plan
- Read, watch, or tell: Saints.   [Brother Francis:The Saints, Our Heavenly Friends on formed.org](https://watch.formed.org/brother-francis-1/season:1/videos/the-saints-our-heavenly-friends) | 
  - St. Mary's provides you a free subscription to formed.org.  Formed.org can be watched in a browser and has apps for Android and Apple devices.
  - Other options: Instead of the video, you can 
     - Tell your child about a saint that important to your family.
     - Watch another story about a saint or holy person on Formed.org: 
         - [St Francis of Assisi](https://watch.formed.org/the-saints-and-heroes-collection/season:1/videos/francis-the-knight-of-assisi) (30 min)
         - [St Bernadette of Lourdes](https://watch.formed.org/the-saints-and-heroes-collection/season:1/videos/bernadette-the-princess-of-lourdes) (30 min)
         - [One or more 5-10 minute stories about Blessed Solanus Casey](https://watch.formed.org/extraordinary-stories-for-children)(1870-1957), a Capuchin priest who served as the doorkeeper at St. Bonadventure Monastery in Detroit.  
- Read: Chapter 27.   
- Optional: Do one of the "Continuing Activities" below

### <a name="ContinuingActivities"> Continuing activities for Developing a relationship with God </a>
- Discuss how to care for your boday and how to care for your soul.
- Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank God for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
 - Optional. Pick flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
 - Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle -- a couple minutes are fine.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus, but I realize that this may not be as easy for homeschool families.  Perhaps you might be able to do this occasionally, either now or after a coronavirus vaccine has been developed.  
    - Near or in Berea, St. Adalbert has Eucharistic Adoration from 9:00 to 6:30pm Tuesdays.  St. Mary of the Falls has Eucharistic Adoration from 7-8pm Tuesdays.  (Based on my experience, St. Mary of the Falls is as good about masking as St. Mary, Berea: Everyone in the church is wearing a mask.  St. Adalbert, from my very limited pandemic experience, isn't as good: In the pandemic version of a "full" church, you might have one or two people not wearing masks.  But I wouldn't expect St. Adalbert to have many people before about 5pm on Tuesdays.)
