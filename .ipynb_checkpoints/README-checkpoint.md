# PSR Grade 1

Text: **Our Heavenly Father** textbook, 3rd ed., Ignatius Press.  Homeschool students also use the activity book.  (In-class students have different activities.)
Required Supplement: Bible stories.  These can be from a children's Bible, videos of Bible stories, or parents telling Bible stories to their children.  Especially for homeschool students, I'm providing links to online videos of the Bible stories we're covering as an alternative to reading the stories.

A summary of the 2021-2022 lesson plan is given in the table below.  As the weeks go by, the table will continue to be filled in.  In addition, each lesson will link to its own web page.

Formed has a second children's video on St. Patrick in the Cathoilc Heroes of the Faith collection.

# Background
The themes for this year are God's love for us and our response to Him.  We learn about God by reading Bible stories, from the Old Testament from September to early November and from the New Testament after that.  I tell these stories using children's Bibles and videos.  The book typically gives very brief versions of the stories.  Its main emphasis is framing the stories in the context of God's love for us.  **The chapters are short: typically 4 pages with no more than 3 pages of text. Everything in the book is important and you should read it at home with your child before or after class, even if your child is attending PSR in person.**  During class, we cover the material in the book through discussion, stories, and games.  We also learn about responding to God's love through prayer: learning the prayers the Sign of the Cross, the Our Father, and the Hail Mary; talking to God in our own words; listing things we would like to thank Him for; preparing flowers to bring to Him in the tabernacle (a very popular activity); and very briefly visiting Him in the tabernacle in the school chapel.
