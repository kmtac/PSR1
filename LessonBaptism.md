## Lesson
1. Read Chapter 24 OR watch [the long version of the Brother Francis video on Baptism](https://watch.formed.org/brother-francis-1/season:1/videos/born-into-the-kingdom-the-miracle-of-baptism)
2. Tell your children about their own baptism.  Tell them who their godparents are (if they don't already know.)  If available, show them pictures, the white garment they wore, and their baptismal candle.

### <a name="ContinuingActivities"> Continuing activities for Developing a relationship with God </a>
- Optional. Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank God for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
 - Optional. Take artificial flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus or a nativity scene.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
 - Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle -- a couple minutes are fine.  This can also be done virtually.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus.
