  - Visit Jesus in the Chapel to say "Hi!"  (Literally: This is what we said this week.)
  
## Homeschool/missed class plan
- Read, watch, or tell: Adam and Eve and the Fall.  If you choose to watch, here's a couple of links, both about 20-30 minutes:
  - [Formed.org: The Animated Bible Series Episode 1](https://watch.formed.org/the-animated-bible-series-the-creation): This covers the stories for lessons 1 and 2 EXCEPT that you will need to emphasize that God promised to send us a savior (Lesson 2).
  - [Formed.org: Brother Francis: Born into the kingdom: The miracle of baptism](https://watch.formed.org/brother-francis-1/season:1/videos/born-into-the-kingdom-the-miracle-of-baptism): This covers the stories for lessons 1 and 2.
- Read: Chapter 2
- Practice and Pray: The Sign of the Cross, the Our Father, and genuflecting
  - Our Father: 
      - Review the first phrase: "Our Father"  (God is everyone's Father)
      - Go over the second phrase: "Who art in Heaven": Discuss heaven.  Also explain that "art" is an old-fashioned way of saying "are".
  - Practice genuflecting.  
  - Optional: Do Activity Book p. 3 if you didn't do it last week.
- Developing a relationship with God:
  - Point 1: Heaven is our true home.
     - Ask your child about times when they've been happy.  Discuss them.  List the best places, tastes, smells, and things to do.  Ask your cild to list the best memories or times they've had. 
     - Optional: Enjoy a small treat.  Focus on the treat (smelling it, focuing on the taste, ...).
     - Tell your child that heaven will be even better than any of these things, and that it will go on forever.
     - Discuss how on earth things sometimes go wrong.  Tell them it won't be that way in heaven.
  - Point 2: Practice the Sign of the Cross.  Tell your child that when we make the Sign of the Cross, we remember how Jesus opened the gates of heaven for us.
  - Continue to notice things to thank God for.  This is a continuing theme for this semester.  See the [Continuing Activities](#ContinuingActivities) section below.
  - Optional.  Decorate or bring flowers to a picture or statue of Jesus.  Or visit Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament.  See the [Continuing Activities](#ContinuingActivities) section below. 
  
### <a name="ContinuingActivities"> Continuing activities for Developing a relationship with God </a>
- Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank GodNot for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
  - Optional. Pick flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
  - Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle $-$ a couple minutes are fine.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus, but I realize that this may not be as easy for homeschool families.  Perhaps you might be able to do this occasionally, either now or after a coronavirus vaccine has been developed.  
    - Near or in Berea, St. Adalbert has Eucharistic Adoration from 9:00 to 6:30pm Tuesdays.  St. Mary of the Falls has Eucharistic Adoration from 7-8pm Tuesdays.  (Based on my experience, St. Mary of the Falls is as good about masking as St. Mary, Berea: Everyone in the church is wearing a mask.  St. Adalbert, from my very limited pandemic experience, isn't as good: In the pandemic version of a "full" church, you might have one or two people not wearing masks.  But I wouldn't expect St. Adalbert to have many people before about 5pm on Tuesdays.)
