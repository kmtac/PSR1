## Lesson
1. Review Christmas and the Epihpany.  Tell/read/watch the story of the Epiphany (above).  Do something fun to celebrate Epiphany!  We celebrated the Solemnity of Epiphany this past Sunday.  The traditional date is coming up on Wednesday -- Jan. 6 (the day after the 12 days of Christmas).  Choose one or more of the ideas below, or make up your own:
      - Follow any Epiphany/Three Kings Day traditions your family may have
      - Sing or listen to "Three Kings of Orient Are" ([music video](https://youtu.be/sJpecRI_0wY)).
      - Make and wear paper crowns to celebrate the three kings.
      - Make, frost, and eat star-shaped cookies to remember the star the magi followed.
      - Dress up as the Three Wise Men.
      - Buy or make an Epiphany cake or other treat to celebrate Epiphany.  In many countries, this is an almond cake.  In England, fruitcake or jam tarts are traditional. (Wikipedia has [an extensive list of customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_(holiday)#National_and_local_customs).)
      - See also the [Review of Lesson 11](#Review) below.
2. Tell how Jesus grew up in a family, with his mother Mary and foster father Joseph.  
    - Tell/read/watch the story of the finding of Jesus in the temple (above).
    - Discuss how Jesus grew up in a family, listening to his parents even though he was God!
3. Pray and practice the prayers above.  This week, please include the short litany to St. Joseph on p. 51 of the book.

### <a name="Review"> Review of Lesson 11</a>
- Discuss where Jesus was born.  Is it surprising the Jesus was born in a stable and not a palace?
- Discuss why Jesus came: to save us from sin and open the gates of heaven.
   - Discuss the Wise Men
       - Who were they?
       - Why were they wise?
       - How did they find Jesus?
       - What gifts did they bring?
       - Explain the meaning of the gifts:
            - Gold: for a king
            - Frankincense: for God
            - Myrhh: for a man (used to anoint the dead)
  
### <a name="ContinuingActivities"> Continuing activities for Developing a relationship with God </a>
- Optional. Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank God for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
 - Optional. Take artificial flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus or a nativity scene.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
 - Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle -- a couple minutes are fine.  This can also be done virtually.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus.  
    - St. Adalbert has Eucharistic Adoration from 9:00 to 6:30pm Tuesdays.  St. Mary of the Falls has Eucharistic Adoration from 7-8pm Tuesdays.  
    - Live-streamed 24/7 Eucharistic adoration: [https://adoration.tyburnconvent.org.uk/](https://adoration.tyburnconvent.org.uk/)
