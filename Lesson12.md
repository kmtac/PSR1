1. Tell how Jesus grew up in a family, with his mother Mary and foster father Joseph.  
    - Tell/read/watch the story of the finding of Jesus in the temple (above).
    - Discuss how Jesus grew up in a family, listening to his parents even though he was God!

### <a name="ContinuingActivities"> Continuing activities for Developing a relationship with God </a>
- Optional. Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank God for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
 - Optional. Take artificial flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus or a nativity scene.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
 - Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle -- a couple minutes are fine.  This can also be done virtually.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus.
