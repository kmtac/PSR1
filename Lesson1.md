# Lesson 1
- Story: Creation
- Book chapter: 1
- Activity book pages: 1-4
- Prayers:
  - The Sign of the Cross
     - Note you make a cross with your arm
     - Jesus is the Son
     - Focus on the hand movements
  - The Our Father
    - Kids repeat after an adult
    - Focus: "Our Father": God is the father of everyone!  Those in Berea, Columbia Station, Olmsted Falls, Sandusky, Michigan, Texas, ...
  - Talking to God in your own words
  - Gratefulness: List things you would like to thank God for.  Go on a walk and notice things to thank God for.
  - Visit Jesus in the Chapel to say "Hi!"  (Literally: This is what we said this week.)
  
## Homeschool/missed class plan
- Read, watch, or tell: The Story of Creation.  If you choose to watch, here's a couple of links, both about 20-30 minutes:
  - [Formed.org: The Animated Bible Series Episode 1](https://watch.formed.org/the-animated-bible-series-the-creation): This covers the stories for lessons 1 and 2 EXCEPT that you will need to emphasize that God promised to send us a savior (Lesson 2).
  - [Formed.org: Brother Francis: Born into the kingdom: The miracle of baptism](https://watch.formed.org/brother-francis-1/season:1/videos/born-into-the-kingdom-the-miracle-of-baptism)
- Read: Chapter 1
- Practice and Pray: The Sign of the Cross and the Our Father
  - With a class, I have the kids repeat the Our Father after me.
  - Our Father: Go over the first phrase: "Our Father"
  - Optional: Do Activity Book p. 3.
- Developing a relationship with God:
  - Have your child list/discuss things they'd like to thank God for.  Some ideas:
    - Take a walk and notice things to thank God for
    - Prayers at meals, bedtime, morning, ...
    - Play a game.  Before each turn, each player lists something they'd like to thank God for.  They get as much help as they need to come up with something.
    - Do p. 2 of the Activity Book 
  - Emphasize that God is a loving Father who takes care of us.  Some ideas:
    - Activity book p. 1
    - Activity book p. 4
  - Optional. Pick flowers and arrange them in a vase.  Put near a statue or picture of Jesus.  (Tends to be a fovorite activity in class.)
  - Optional. Make a short visit to Jesus in the tabernacle $-$ a couple minutes are fine.  I think even a few minute visit can really help your child develop a relationship with Jesus, but I realize that this may not be as easy for homeschool families.  Perhaps you might be able to do this occasionally, either now or after a coronavirus vaccine has been developed.  
    - Near or in Berea, St. Adalbert has Eucharistic Adoration from 9:00 to 6:30pm Tuesdays.  St. Mary of the Falls has Eucharistic Adoration from 7-8pm Tuesdays.  (Based on my experience, St. Mary of the Falls is as good about masking as St. Mary, Berea: Everyone in the church is wearing a mask.  St. Adalbert, from my very limited pandemic experience, isn't as good: In the pandemic version of a "full" church, you might have one or two people not wearing masks.  But I wouldn't expect St. Adalbert to have many people before about 5pm on Tuesdays.)
